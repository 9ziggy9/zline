** Inspiration
Can I implement a Redux-like FSM which can manage TUI applications? Could be helpful for early programmers learning JS that would like to make a simple terminal application.
** Why JavaScript?
My students learn JS as their first language. I am debating implementing this in TS.
I might leverage some C for diffing, etc. Since this is a TUI framework, this shouldn't be a problem if I only use C standard libraries--does anyone not ship with GCC?

- I don't know TS, here goes nothing. Can I create make files?
